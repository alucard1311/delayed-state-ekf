Orpheus Ocean is seeking a full-time Autonomy/GNC (Guidance, Navigation, & Control) Engineer with a strong foundation in autonomous robotics, geodetic navigation, sensor-fusion, and software design & development to help lead development of our foundational autonomy stack. As part of our core engineering team, you will help advance the deep-ocean exploration capabilities of our autonomous platforms, supporting environmental monitoring and surveying for rapidly expanding sectors of the blue economy - including offshore wind, seabed minerals, and critical subsea infrastructure.

This is a hands-on engineering role with high impact on both our R&D and field deployment programs. You will collaborate closely with hardware, electrical, and mission operations teams to integrate your solutions into real-world missions. This role is ideal for someone who takes pride in clean codebases, robust tooling, and high-quality software infrastructure.

This role is in-person, in southern Massachusetts, with some flexibility for occasional work from home. Applicants should plan on 2-3 months of travel during the first year, possibly for at-sea deployments for several weeks at a time.

Company Description: Orpheus Ocean is revolutionizing exploration of Earth's final frontier. We are a venture-backed, Massachusetts-based startup that is designing, building and operating novel autonomous systems for ultra-scalable ocean access, to unlock the future of the blue economy. Our flagship Orpheus AUV is the first to enable autonomous interaction with the seafloor and exploration of deep ocean environments. Learn more at

Duties/Responsibilities: As an Autonomy Engineer at Orpheus Ocean, you will work closely with a multidisciplinary team to design and deliver robust autonomy and navigation systems for our AUVs and supporting infrastructure. Responsibilities include:

Design and develop sensor fusion, control and navigation algorithms for closed-loop odometry in both GPS-denied and GPS-aided environments, including integration with USBL beacons and geodetic error correction.
Design and implement autonomous behaviors that utilize multiple sensor configurations for deep ocean exploration and interaction, including error handling, health monitoring, and fail-safes.
Develop and manage the existing autonomy stack including the ROS/ROS2 packages in C++ and Python.
Design and implementation of autonomous state machine for decision-making and reliability.
Develop and conduct testing in containerized simulation environments to evaluate autonomous behaviors before field testing.
Develop and improve mission planning workflows and collaborate with operations team to execute in-field missions.
Design and own methods for storing, handling, processing, visualizing and delivering data products to customers.
Structure and maintain modular, well-documented repositories using GitHub.
Implement and maintain unit tests and CI/CD pipelines to ensure software reliability.
Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams including electrical, embedded systems, and mechanical engineering to ensure software integrates smoothly with hardware systems.
Participation in frequent near-shore field small boat testing (day trips or shorter duration)
Participate in offshore field work (either remotely or on-vessel, 1-3 week duration)
This role offers significant ownership, hands-on work, and direct impact on next-generation ocean robotics.

About You: You are a self-motivated engineer who thrives in fast-paced, hardware-driven environments and enjoys tackling hard technical challenges. With appropriate guidance, you can independently take assignments from concept to finished product with rigor and creativity. You are driven to do whatever it takes to get the job done, wearing numerous hats across responsibilities and disciplines, while enthusiastically learning outside of your existing skillset and experiences. You are capable of working across software design, testing, and deployment phases. You communicate clearly, collaborate well as a part of an interdisciplinary team, and are energized by building real systems that operate in the ocean.

As a pivotal member of our early-stage team, you must be enthusiastic and prepared to overcome the challenges associated with a growing seed-stage startup, and do so with respect, responsibility, and resilience. You must be adaptive and continually in pursuit of self/team-improvement in a workplace culture that expects all team members to both positively solicit and provide frequent constructive feedback to/from all colleagues, supervisor, and executives.
